Get items working again

Check through heroku setup

# Notes from meeting

https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov

Don't use default scope - scope is hidden

Test scopes
Controller tests for session access - request a round and see whether you get the right response back
before and after tests for logging in as user etc
check for routes that are enabled or disabled

Also...

Spend time daily on tools etc

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
